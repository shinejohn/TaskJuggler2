# Magic Patterns to Supabase Integration Guide

## What Was Done

1. **Component Analysis**
   - Scanned all components for data dependencies
   - Extracted mock data to seed files
   - Created audit report in `docs/component-audit.md`

2. **Data Layer Created**
   - Query functions in `src/lib/supabase/queries/`
   - React Query hooks in `src/hooks/queries/`
   - Type mappings in `src/types/component-db-mappings.ts`

3. **Routes Generated**
   - SSR routes in `src/app/[feature]/`
   - Each route fetches data server-side
   - Loading and error states included

4. **Components Updated**
   - Mock data removed/commented
   - TODO comments added for prop updates
   - Components now expect data via props

## Next Steps

1. **Update Your Database Types**
   ```bash
   npm run types
